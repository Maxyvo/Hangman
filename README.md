## Purpose
Hangman is a word guessing game.
The goal is to guess a word by guessing the letters of the word.
Every time the player guesses a wrong letter, an extra part of a hanged man is drawn.
After six wrong guesses, the player loses the game and the word is revealed.

You win if you find the word with less than six wrong guesses.

## Note
The list of words can be updated by adding to the words.txt text file and needs to contain one word per line.
